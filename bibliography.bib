  abstract = {Author SummarySome mutations occur more frequently than others. We need to understand these biases if we are to interpret the differences that have accumulated between species and individuals. Applications include estimating the time since evolutionary lineages diverged and detecting the signature of natural selection in DNA sequences. However, mutational biases have been obscured because, since mutations arose, natural selection has eliminated some whilst allowing others to persist to the present. We therefore study mutations that have accumulated in regions of the genome that are free from selection in a grasshopper with a gigantic genome. All other animal studies using this approach find an excess of mutations between DNA bases having similar biochemical properties (transitions rather than transversions). This bias has been widely interpreted as a consequence of the fundamental biochemical basis of mutation. However, once we exclude mutations associated with DNA methylation, we find no evidence of a transition bias, unlike the few comparable animal studies that make the same correction. We propose that this result indicates previously unanticipated differences between species in the selection on or mutation of their DNA.},

  abstract="A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of species from DNA sequence data by a molecular clock approach is developed. This method takes into account effectively the information contained in a set of DNA sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized leastsquares method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3{\textpm}11.7, 13.3{\textpm}1.5, 10.9{\textpm}1.2, 3.7{\textpm}0.6, and 2.7{\textpm}0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the bipedal creatureAustralopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a protochimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.",

@article{Kimura1980,
  Abstract = {Some simple formulae were obtained which enable us to estimate evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions (and, also, the evolutionary rates when the divergence times are known). In comparing a pair of nucleotide sequences, we distinguish two types of differences; if homologous sites are occupied by different nucleotide bases but both are purines or both pyrimidines, the difference is called type I (or ``transition''type), while, if one of the two is a purine and the other is a pyrimidine, the difference is called type II (or ``transversion''type). Letting P and Q be respectively the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences between two sequences compared, then the evolutionary distance per site is K = ---(1/2) ln {\{}(1 ---2P ---Q) {\}}. The evolutionary rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions are compared, the synonymous component of the evolutionary base substitutions per site is estimated by K'S = ---(1/2) ln (1 ---2P ---Q). Also, formulae for standard errors were obtained. Some examples were worked out using reported globin sequences to show that synonymous substitutions occur at much higher rates than amino acid-altering substitutions in evolution.},

A computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. This method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. It also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.",
